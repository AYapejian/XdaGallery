Chrome Extension to view XDA forum threads as an image gallery

This only works, and button is only enabled, on XDA topic urls which follow the format: `http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=<SOME TOPIC ID>`

XDA threads seem to open with this format, almost always, when browsing the forum normally.  Sometimes if you arrive at a topic url via google, or it's a very old topic the url format will be different and that extension button will stay disabled, this is by design to eliminate any errors parsing the page for images.

##Examples URLs:

Broswing either of these urls will give you an example of the expected format, and a working gallery page by clicking the extension button:

##Known Issues:

* Sometimes gallery page will fail to load
  * Close tab and retry, if it still fails, then it must be a bug
* The gallery page is ugly as hell!
  * Very known issue, see "Alpha" title above, working on functionality first :op
